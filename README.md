# JavaScript Web Design Playground

This repository is where I explore and practice **JavaScript-based web design**. It includes interactive mini-projects that help me understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic UI creation.

### Bill Splitter
A lightweight and user-friendly web app to fairly split expenses among friends and family. Designed especially for situations where **one person pays for everything** — such as trips, grocery shopping, or group outings — and needs a quick way to calculate who owes what.
- **Ideal for group payments**: Perfect when one person covers all costs and needs to calculate each person’s share easily.
- **Item-based splitting**: Enter the item name, cost, and select who shared it — the app calculates each person’s share automatically.
- **Instant recalculation / undo**: Entries can be reversed easily if mistakes are made.
- **Keyboard-friendly**: Fully operable using only the keyboard for faster and more efficient usage.
- **Responsive design**: Works on both **desktop and mobile devices** (optimized for desktop experience).
- **Clean and friendly interface**: Simple layout to keep focus on what matters — splitting the bill.
- **No login, no setup**: Runs directly in the browser with zero configuration required.
